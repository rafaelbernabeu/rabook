# Big O notation


### O(1)
O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.


### O(N)
O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.


### O(N2)
O(N2) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N3), O(N4) etc.

### O(2N)
O(2N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2N) function is exponential - starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically. An example of an O(2N) function is the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers
